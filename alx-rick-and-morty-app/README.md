# Project Description
A continuation of the rick and morty app with further updates and in a new repository.

# Objective
1. Implement an ErrorBoundary class component in TypeScript that can catch and handle JavaScript errors in your application.
2. Integrate the ErrorBoundary component into your Next.js application by wrapping the main component.
3. Develop a simple component that intentionally throws an error to test the ErrorBoundary functionality.
4. Integrate an error monitoring service (e.g., Sentry) into the ErrorBoundary to log errors.
